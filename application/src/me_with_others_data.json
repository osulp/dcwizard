Sometimes datasets are made publicly available with restrictive licenses even though they are not covered by Copyright. To make sure that the restrictions indicated by the license are applicable to the dataset you are interested in, determine first if the dataset is covered by Copyright. Most datasets that are composed of numbers (facts) are not covered. Even datasets or databases that are arranged or organized in a creative way are not protected by Copyright. The organizational method may be copyrightable, but not the facts. Some datasets are creative and therefore subject to copyright. For example, a collection of images, or a collection of texts would be protected by Copyright.\n",

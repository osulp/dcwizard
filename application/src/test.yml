    question_text: Is the dataset covered by Copyright?
    explanation_text: |
      Representations of data are also not protectable.
      Facts and data aren't considered original works of authorship because they are not “created” so much as they are “discovered.”
      This implies that many datasets are not covered by Copyright.
      Sometimes datasets are made publicly available with restrictive licenses even though they are not covered by Copyright.
      To make sure that the restrictions indicated by the license are applicable to the dataset you are interested in,
      determine first if the dataset is covered by Copyright.

            In this case, to know if you can use, reuse, modify or redistribute the dataset you will have to do a fair use assessment.
            The OSU's copyright page https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/copyright/fairuse
            has information and resources to help you make a good fair use assesment.

            In this case, the data is not protected
            and you can use, reuse, modify and redistribute the dataset as you want.

- question_5:
    question_id: 1_1_2
    question_text: Is there any Data Sharing Agreement or similar document that outlines what you can do with the dataset?
    explanation_text: |
      If you have a dataset that you have not obtained from a publicly available source (e.g. online),
      then you probably obtained from a person who gave it to you, or you bought it.
      Ideally, when the data was handed to you, both of you reached an agreement about the conditions surrounding this dataset.
      A written agreement, like a Data Sharing Agreement, is the best case scenario.

          next_step_content: |
            The Data Sharing Agreement or written document should have all the information you need to decide what you can do with the dataset.
            If it doesn't, answer No to this question.

            You will need to contact the person who handed you the data.
            If you had a verbal, non official agreement honor that agreement, and work on making the agreement formal and in writing.
            If there wasn't any agreement, contact the person who gave you the data or the person who can make decisions over the dataset
            and talk about how you can use the dataset.

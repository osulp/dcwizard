		"finished": "It is tricky to know what other people within the project can do related to the data generated for that project. This is because the concept of data ownership is not straightforward, and because people other than the owner may have the power to make decisions over the dataset. The situation can also be very different from one project to the next. The larger the project, with more people and organizations involved, the harder to figure out. We will explain here the most usual scenario, but know that it may be entirely different in your case. Contact us if you want more personalized advice. Let's work with the scenario that a research group working at Oregon State University got a grant from a federal agency, and that there is one principal investigator and several other investigators, postdocs and students in the project. The owner of the dataset tends to be the organization that received the grant, in this example Oregon State University. The principal investigator is not the owner of the dataset, but is usually the person who manages the dataset and makes everyday decisions about what can be done with the dataset: when to publish it, who to share it with, etc. The fact that the PI is not the owner means that she would not be able to take the dataset with her if she left the university, unless she worked out an agreement with the University to do so. It works similarly to other things that are bought with scientific awards: a computer may be bought with grant money, and the researcher can use it and manage it, and install any programs he wants in it, but if he leaves the university he has to leave the computer behind, because it is university property. The relationship with the funder is usually in writing, and it may dictate what the researcher or the university can do with the data. For example, a federal agency may have a policy that requires data to be made publicly available at the time of publication or at a certain time after the end of the project."

For more information about how copyright will affect datasets, navigate to the beginning of this question thread and choose \"Yes\" to the question \"Is your data publicly available\". However, it is advisable to have clear agreements with collaborators with whom datasets are shared. The only way of ensuring that all the collaborators are aware and agree with the terms of the data sharing is to have a conversation about it, and to put the conclusions of the conversation in writing. This written document will be more useful if it is detailed. It should talk about rights of reproduction, distribution of the dataset, public display of the dataset and the preparation of derivative works, in a way similar to the way that data licenses operate. Include also detailed information such as what data will be shared, who will be shared with, when it will be shared, in which shape it will be shared (format, level of quality control, etc), and how will the collaborators acknowledge data creators or how co-authorship  will be managed over works that use the data."

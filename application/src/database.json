		"finished": "It is tricky to know what other people within the project can do related to the data generated for that project. This is because the concept of data ownership is not straightforward, and because people other than the owner may have the power to make decisions over the dataset. The situation can also be very different from one project to the next. The larger the project, with more people and organizations involved, the harder to figure out. We will explain here the most usual scenario, but know that it may be entirely different in your case. Contact us if you want more personalized advice. Let's work with the scenario that a research group working at Oregon State University got a grant from a federal agency, and that there is one principal investigator and several other investigators, postdocs and students in the project. The owner of the dataset tends to be the organization that received the grant, in this example Oregon State University. The principal investigator is not the owner of the dataset, but is usually the person who manages the dataset and makes everyday decisions about what can be done with the dataset: when to publish it, who to share it with, etc. The fact that the PI is not the owner means that she would not be able to take the dataset with her if she left the university, unless she worked out an agreement with the University to do so. It works similarly to other things that are bought with scientific awards: a computer may be bought with grant money, and the researcher can use it and manage it, and install any programs he wants in it, but if he leaves the university he has to leave the computer behind, because it is university property. The relationship with the funder is usually in writing, and it may dictate what the researcher or the university can do with the data. For example, a federal agency may have a policy that requires data to be made publicly available at the time of publication or at a certain time after the end of the project."

However, it is advisable to have clear agreements with collaborators with whom datasets are shared. The only way of ensuring that all the collaborators are aware and agree with the terms of the data sharing is to have a conversation about it, and to put the conclusions of the conversation in writing. This written document will be more useful if it is detailed. It should talk about rights of reproduction, distribution of the dataset, public display of the dataset and the preparation of derivative works, in a way similar to the way that data licenses operate. Include also detailed information such as what data will be shared, who will be shared with, when it will be shared, in which shape it will be shared (format, level of quality control, etc), and how will the collaborators acknowledge data creators or how co-authorship  will be managed over works that use the data."

Ethical considerations are most relevant when the dataset is about human subjects, but there are other cases in which they may also be a relevant factor.

If your study includes both research and human subjects at Oregon State University, you or somebody in your project worked with the Office of Research Integrity at the beginning of the project and your research plan was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (or was exempt of revision). If that is the case, make sure that you review the documents resulting from the IRB review, and do what you said you would do with the data. You may need to remove some data from your dataset in order to publish it, to protect human subjects. Contact the Research Office at Oregon State University if you have questions. \n\n  Consider also other people who have worked on the dataset.

	         "explanation": "The last thing to take into consideration is whether your dataset is protected by copyright. If it is, you have certain rights and you will have to decide how to manage them. If it is not, when you publish or share your dataset it will be in the public domain and other people will be able to use, reuse, publish and make derivatives from your dataset. This is actually a good thing! We will get into details in a moment. \n\n  To evaluate whether a dataset is covered by copyright we need to take a look at the U.S. Copyright Act.  Section 102(b) of the U.S. Copyright Act reads: \"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\"  \n\n Facts and data aren't considered original works of authorship because they are not \"created\" so much as they are \"discovered.\" For example, if a scientist takes temperature readings at various locations over a period of years, she isn't \"creating\" the data, she's recording the data. If she keeps a log describing how she feels every day, and how the sunrise looks at the testing station, that's original, creative, authorship.  Recording natural phenomena is not.\" (Glushko) \n\n This implies that many datasets are not covered by Copyright. Most datasets that are composed of numbers (facts) are not covered. Even datasets or databases that are arranged or organized in a creative way are not protected by Copyright. The organizational method may be copyrightable, but not the facts, the data in it. Some datasets are creative and therefore subject to copyright. For example, a collection of images, or a collection of texts would be protected by Copyright. \n\n  Examples of non creative datasets: instrument measurements. Observational data. Tabular, numerical datasets. Examples of creative datasets: collections of photographs taken by people, interviews, drawings, texts.   ",

Your particular project may involve collaborations between different institutions. Maybe there are some private companies that are investing in your project. Maybe you have international collaborators. \n\n One thing that is good to know is that working very hard, spending huge amounts of hours and effort into generating a dataset, does not have anything to do with data ownership. People don't get to own a dataset because they have worked on it, even if they have generated it on their entirety. Generally, the dataset does not belong to the PI either. Usually it belongs to the university, although there may be exceptions. Students, researchers the PI and the other members of the research team are not the owners of the dataset, but they can use the data, and publish research about it. The PI often acts as the custodian of the data. Students, researchers, PIs also have the responsibility of managing the data. \n\n  There are some exceptional situations in which the researcher who is working on generating the dataset is bringing his/her own money, and is not using significant resources from the university (computers, labs, support from university employers, etc).

	        "explanation": "Data Management Plans are documents that are written in the early stages of a grant, usually during the proposal submission phase, that describe how the data will be managed during the research project. Data Management Plans can vary, but usually include the following information: description of the types of data that will be collected, and how they will be collected; how the data will be documented and kept safe; all the details about how data will be made publicly available and shared, including when it will be shared, in which format, protection of privacy rights, policies around reuse, redistribution and creation of derivatives; and provisions for data archival and preservation. Data management plans may contain definitions of roles and responsibilities related to data management. The most important piece of information that you will be looking for in the Data Management Plan is who is the person in charge of making decisions over your data. Sometimes this person will be the same as the data owner, but usually it won't. In some Data Management Plans this person is called data custodian. \n\n  There are many reasons why a Data Management Plan may not have the information you are looking for. Data Management Plans are written before the grant is even funded, so they tend to be general, and they may not be very detailed about day to day specific data management tasks, like data organization. Data Management Plans are also a relatively new requirement in most grant applications, and many times it is not clear whether a successful grant application implies that the Data Management Plan is of good quality and complete. The degree of complicance requested from researchers by a funder also varies, so you may find that your group is not following the guidelines outlined in the Data Management Plan. Many Data Management Plans don't have a Roles and Responsibilities section, so the information about who makes decisions over your dataset may not be there. \n\n A Data Management Plan can be very useful to understand the expectations around dataset management in a research project. If there is a Data Management Plan for your project we encourage you to read it. Best case scenario is that the Data Management Plan tells you who the data custodian (the person who gets to make decisions about the data) is. Even if the data management plan has specific information about what you are looking for (e.g. when the data should be made publicly available) is always best to double check with the data custodian.  \n\n  If you have figured out that this dataset is not \"yours\" and want to learn more about what you will be able to do with this dataset, go to the home page and choose \"What can I do with other people's data?\". If you have discovered that you are the person who gets to make the decisions about your dataset (congratulations!) go to the home page and choose \"What can I do with my own data?\". Make sure that you indicate that you know who the person making decisions about the dataset is, this time. \"",

				  "questionTitle": "Funding",

					 "explanation": "Conducting research requires resources. Where are the resources to generate the dataset coming from? Remember that there may be many resources to take into account: money for data collection, salaries for people involved in the project, availability to use lab space and equipment, support staff, etc. \n\n Sometimes the student brings the funding, and gets no significant resources from the university or the student's supervisor. In these cases, it is likely that the owner of the dataset is the student. The student, then, gets to make most the decisions around the dataset, and gets to take the dataset with him/her if he/she decides to change institutions. \n\n  Sometimes there is a grant that pays for most of the expenses associated with the project, awarded to a researcher employed by a university. If this is the case, even though the University is probably the official owner of the dataset, one of the researchers in the research group tends to act as data custodian, and is the person who will make most of the decisions concerning the dataset. Usually it is the PI. \n\n  Sometimes there won't be a clear cut answer. For example, you may be a student with your own fellowship, working on a dataset that does not require funds for data collection (e.g. some type of modeling), but you may still be using university resources. Are you using a computer or lab space from the university? Are you relying on university staff that help you perform your research (e.g. IT people to manage the server that you are running the model into)? Are you relying heavily on the advice given by your supervisor (e.g. an investigator paid for, at least partially, from the university)? Some other times the project may be large, and involve many institutions and several funding sources. These cases should be evaluated one by one, and all the documentation regarding collaboration between partners should be taken into account. \n\n   In all cases, simple or complex, it is worth checking with the funder if there are policies or regulations regarding what the researchers can do with the data. Review any signed paperwork, and contact the funder directly with questions. After doing this work, there can still be policies or regulations regarding what the researchers can do with the data, we will explore them in the next point. ",

On February 2013 The Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a memo in which it directed each \"Federal agency with over $100 million in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the Federal Government\".

For more information about open data you can visit Open Data Commons. \n\n  Some researchers are concerned about not getting credit for the hard work of building their dataset. Giving proper attribution is an ethical requirement, rather than a legal one, and everybody using your dataset should give you attribution. In the scholarly community giving atribution is a clear expectation, and not doing it can be considered data plagiarism, a serious form of research misconduct. You can encourage other researchers to cite your work by attaching a CC-BY license to your dataset and by publishing your dataset in a repository that has easy to follow instructions about citing datasets.
